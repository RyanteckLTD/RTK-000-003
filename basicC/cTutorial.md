**Download and Install wiringPi (the C library for controlling GPIOs)**

If you do not have GIT installed, then under any of the Debian releases (e.g. Raspbian), you can install it with:

```sudo apt-get install git-core```

If you get any errors here, make sure your Pi is up to date with the latest versions of Raspbian:

```sudo apt-get update```
```sudo apt-get upgrade```

To obtain WiringPi using GIT:

```git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi```

If you have already used the clone operation for the first time, then

```cd wiringPi
git pull origin```

Will fetch an updated version then you can re-run the build script below.

To build/install there is a new simplified script:
```
cd wiringPi
./build
```

The new build script will compile and install it all for you â€“ it does use the sudo command at one point, so you may wish to inspect the script before running it.

**How to compile**

To compile exampleCode.c:
```gcc -Wall -o exampleCode exampleCode.c -lwiringPi```
And then to run it:
```sudo ./exampleCode```

To compile spinRobot.c:
```gcc -Wall -o spinRobot spinRobot.c -lwiringPi```
And then to run it:
```sudo ./spinRobot```
