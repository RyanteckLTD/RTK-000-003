Raspberry Pi Setup & Configuration Guide
===========
Before you can do anything with a Raspberry Pi you will need to configure it ready for use. Here we will be writing Raspbian to an SD Card and configuring it over SSH.

SSH Is short for Secure Shell and provides us with a command line interface over a secure connection between both the computer and Raspberry Pi.
Altough at times a command line interface can be scary it is the most effecient way to work with a Robot as it requires no keyboards and screens to be connected.


SD Card burning
-----------
The first step is to burn your SD card for use with the Raspberry Pi, we will be using the offical Raspbian Image and not Noobs. This is from where it is usually quicker to use when running without a screen.

First download the latest version of Raspbian from http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest and then unzip it onto your computers disk drive. Next follow the instructions for your Operating System.

###Windows
