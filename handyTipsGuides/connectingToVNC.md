Connecting to your Raspberry Pi using VNC
=============

Cross platform
-----------
There are two cross platform methods to connect to a VNC server running on the raspberry Pi.
##VNC Viewer for Google Chrome
One of the easiest ways to be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi is by installing the VNC Viewer for Google Chrome application from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc-viewer-for-google-chr/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla
This is maintained by RealVNC who maintain their own version of VNC which can offer extra features for a paid price. The client for chrome is free to use.

After downloading navigate to chrome://apps/ in chrome and then click on the VNC icon (You may have to swap pages using the arrows at the sides). After you should be presented with the following screen.
