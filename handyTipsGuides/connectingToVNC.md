Connecting to your Raspberry Pi using VNC
=============
First you need to know the IP address of your Raspberry Pi and make sure it is already connected to the same network. See findingYourIp & wirelessConnection guides.

Cross platform
-----------
There are two cross platform methods to connect to a VNC server running on the raspberry Pi.
###VNC Viewer for Google Chrome
One of the easiest ways to be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi is by installing the VNC Viewer for Google Chrome application from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vnc-viewer-for-google-chr/iabmpiboiopbgfabjmgeedhcmjenhbla
This is maintained by RealVNC who maintain their own version of VNC which can offer extra features for a paid price. The client for chrome is free to use.

After downloading navigate to <a href="chrome://apps" target="_blank">chrome://apps</a> in chrome and then click on the VNC icon (You may have to swap pages using the arrows at the sides). After you should be presented with the following screen.

Next type the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi with a :1 after (without spaces) into the address box. Leave quality as automatic (this will pick the best quality / speed mixture for you, over a LAN network this should be good quality and speed).
After you may have an warning message appear about not using an encrypted connection, this is not an issue as you are not transmitting confidential information and are on a local area network.

You should now be connected to your Raspberry Pi!
