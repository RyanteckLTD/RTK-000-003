After the application has installed it is as simple as launching it and then clicking the refresh icon in the top right of the application. You should see all of the devices on the network appear.

A Raspberry Pi connected via the ethernet cable will show as Raspberry Pi Foundation, the Wi-Fi adapters we provide identify as Shenzhen Ogemray Technology which is the IP address we want.
Make a note of this IP address and you are done!, You can also assign icons to each device by pressing down the button and clicking change icon. At the bottom there is one for Raspberry Pi.
