#Contributing to the Ryanteck Budget Robotics Kit
If you build an awesome project or fancy helping out improving the Ryanteck Budget Robotics Kit this is the place to start. 

All of the documentation is licensed under CC BY-SA & the code is licensed under GPLv3, this means you are free to share, modify and re-distribute any of the code or documentation here as long as attribution is given.

##How you can help?
* Proof Reading - My English isn't the greatest which is why proof reading is so handy for you to do. If your new to GIT it is also a good way to be able to start learning how to commit.
* Testing the documentation - While the documentation may work in white box testing, black box testing is really handy for us to have. Once you have your kit try the code and documentation out. If there is any errors just report them!
* Creating more code - Do you have an awesome project you would like others to make? You can contribute the code and create a tutorial for others to make by cloaning the repository, creating a folder under the publicCode folder to store it all in and then doing a pull request. If we think it's awesome we will add it, if not then others will still be able to access it via your Copy of the repo.
* Donating - This documentation takes a lot of time (and coffee) to write, instead of giving us a direct donation you can help fund it by either buying a Robotics Kit, Motor Controller, or in the future the PDF version of this documentation.
